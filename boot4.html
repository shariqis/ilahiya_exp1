        <p>All instances in Python must be instances of a class that derives from BaseException. Two exception classes
            that are not related via subclassing are never equivalent, even if they have the same name. The built-in
            exceptions can be generated by the interpreter or built-in functions.

            There are several built-in exceptions in Python that are raised when errors occur. These built-in exceptions
            can be viewed using the local() built-in functions as follows :</p>
